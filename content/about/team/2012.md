These were the core executives in the 2012–2013 academic year.

### President <president \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Sean Lee \
I’m a 4th year student who is majoring in Cognitive Systems (probably going to change majors to Computer Science). I don’t have much of a particular interest in much of anything when it comes to school, though it turns out I really like CPSC 320 so far. It’s like a course on puzzle solving with just enough math to make it beautiful, but not difficult. If I was to describe myself as I am right now, it would be with a quote by Eleanor Rooseevelt: “I am who I am today, because of the choices I made yesterday.” I am, as much as I hate to admit it, a mere worm of a man and I work hard to build up my character every day. Well, at least I’m motivated to change myself. Oh, and it’s worth mentioning I was not elected, but appointed as president and am struggling to figure out what I’m supposed to do. Other than that, I enjoy listening to jazz, working out, watching animé, and playing DOTA, though I don’t get much time for video games these days.

### Vice President, Administration <vpa \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Michael Wu \
I’ve been a proud member of the CSSS since the first day I set foot in it. It has given me so many great opportunities and chances in meeting and working with so many different people that it was a no brainer to give back by getting involved, and I encourage you to do so as well! In my spare time I enjoy cycling, swimming, baseball, coding, and, of course, the vidya. Say hi if you see me!

### Vice President, Communications <vpc \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Matthew Arnold \
I’m Matthew Arnold, a 3rd year Computer Science student at UBC. I’m a big gamer, so I play Q3A, CS, TF2, DotA, and SCII. I hope to help the CSSS be a welcoming place so that CS undergrads have somewhere to hang out and talk.

### Vice President, External <vpx \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Richard Lo

### Vice President, Financial <vpf \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Anmol Gupta \
Anmol is a third year student doing a combined major in Business and Computer Science. He was born and brought up in Singapore and his current interests include traveling, watching planes (yes it’s a hobby!), as well as playing cricket. He looks forward to working with the Cube this year.

### Vice President, Internal <vpi \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Kerry Li \
Kerry is a 3rd year Arts-Computer Science student in his 4th year at UBC who had never programmed coming into university. He doesn’t really have
specific academic interests yet. His other interests include sports (and E-SPORTS), gaming, game design, and making spreadsheets. He can almost always be found inside the Cube.

### Vice President, Social <vps \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Akshat Divekar \
I am a third-year student doing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Commerce. I have participated in CSSS initiatives before and wanted to be an exec ever since I entered UBC. I am currently on co-op doing some pretty exciting stuff (that’s never been done before!!). I am interested in problem solving and finding ways to optimize solutions to a problem, even at my workplace. Outside of school, I enjoy working out, swimming, and hanging out with friends. If you have questions about any of the social events, have any ideas, or just want to say a hi, hit me up at the e-mail address above or whenever you see me around campus.

### Vice President, Volunteering Services <vpv \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>

**Name:** Angel Cheung \
Angel is a 4th year Computer Science major, Commerce minor. Her academic interests lie in human computer interaction and mobile apps (specifically on Android). Outside of school, Angel likes to listen to catchy music, chat with her friends, and spend way too much time on the Internet.
