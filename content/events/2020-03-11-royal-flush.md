The undercurrent of tense energy is electric. Hear balls whir, dice clink -- each dance tempting fate a little more -- drowned out by the clink of glasses between patrons sitting just a hair too close (highballs, whisky tumblers, champagne flutes), celebratory and consolatory, olives tumbling in translucent liquid luck. Long, endless velvets cushion murmurs of intrigue and backroom deals. 
Dive into the warm night: the swaying palms, a full moon glinting off ostentatious gold Casios and dribbled strings of pearls. Are you willing to play the odds?
