Breaks in the rain are for BBQing—the Cube is having a slick BBQ outside Reboot/Hugh Dempster (weather permitting). Come eat! Note the BBQ will end early if we run out of food, so if possible plan to arrive closer to noon.

By the way, volunteers are needed to help with this as well! No experience is required and you get free lunch if you volunteer. If you’re willing to help out with
future BBQs as well, we’ll even pay for your FoodSafe certification. E-mail [Grant Harris](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f1878182b185999492849394df9290) if you’d like to get involved.

When: 

Friday, October 26, 2012 - 12:00 to 15:00

Where:
