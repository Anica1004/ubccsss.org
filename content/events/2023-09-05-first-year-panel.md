Hey first year students! Got any burning questions about CS programs, careers, and admissions you want answered? Come to our First Year Panel Q&A where upper-year CS students and professors will share their experience and knowledge! This is also a great opportunity for you to get to know your peers and make new friends at the start of the term! 

RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/cnqvDMnmBhzgDA999) to join the event!

Date & Time: September 11th, 6-7PM  
Location: LIFE 2302

Speaker bios:
- **Professor Mike Feeley**: Mike Feeley is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at UBC and a member of the Systopia Group. His research is in the area of operating systems and distributed systems, particularly small-scale distributed computing in workstation and personal computer clusters. His active project areas include peer-to-peer file systems, mobile ad hoc networks, and scalable system structures. At UBC, he has taught CPSC 210, 213, and 313, and has been awarded the UBC Killam Teaching Prize, the Faculty of Science Distinguished Research and Teaching Awards, the Computer Science Undergraduate Team Award and the Computer Science Department Teaching Award.
- **Professor Gregor Kiczales**: Gregor Kiczales is Professor of Computer Science at UBC, and a fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery. His research is directed at enabling programmers to write programs that, as much as possible, look like their design. This has included work in object-oriented programming - the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and its standard implementation PCL; work in reflection â€“ The Art of the Metaobject Protocol and The CLOS Metaobject Protocol; and work in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) - leading the team that developed AOP and AspectJ. At UBC his main focus has been on education, with a particular focus on developing a course that delivers students a substantive introduction to software engineering in their first term of computer science study. As part of this he developed an edX MOOC and continues the ongoing development of 110, autograder infrastructure and other course materials.
- **Professor Joanna McGrenere**: Joanna McGrenere is a Co-Head and Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC, Canada). Her broad research area is Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with a specialization in interface personalization, universal usability, assistive technology, and computer supported cooperative work. She often serves on the program and organizing committees for the top conferences in HCI. At UBC, Joanna has received the Killam Research Award and Killam Award for Excellence in Mentoring. She also kickstarted and led the HCI@UBC initiative: an interdisciplinary meeting for scholars working in the area of Human-Computer Interaction across UBC campus which has been rebranded as the Designing for People initiative. As well, she has taught CPSC 110 several times in the past.
- **Michael DeMarco**: Michael is a fifth-year Honours Computer Science and Data Science minor student. He's previously interned at companies like Tesla and Amazon through UBC's co-op program, served as a teaching assistant for a variety of introductory courses, and conducted research through directed studies.
- **Ryan Kim**: Hello everyone! My name is Ryan and I am in my fourth year of Computer Science at UBC. I am the President of UBC Computer Science Student Society for the current school year and have been part of other clubs such as the Science Undergraduate Society, Launch Pad, Google Development Student Club, and Game Development Club. I am currently on co-op at Cisco as a Software Engineer Intern and was previously on co-op at SAP and UBC as a Worklearn student. Feel free to ask me questions about anything you have in mind!
- **Jessie Shang**: Hello, everyone! I'm Jessie, a third-year computer science student at UBC. I recently made a significant switch from CPEN to CPSC, so if you're considering a similar move or have questions about the differences between the two programs, I'd be happy to share my perspective. I'm also involved in design teams like Launchpad and UBC BEST, and I spent my summer doing machine learning research. Whether it's academics, extracurriculars, or anything else related to computer science, feel free to ask me any questions.
