#### WHAT 
CS Coffee Chat is a program that randomly pairs a lower year student with an upper year student for a quick meet-up on a monthly basis. This is a low-commitment and informal opportunity for lower year students to ask questions about Computer Science majors, classes, extracurriculars, or internships and upper year students to share their experiences! 

Make new friends and get to know other people walking around ICICS :)
