> 317 with Donald Acton is pretty fun. Networking is sort of my jam though, so I'm a bit biased. I found the text incredibly interesting. It's really the only instance of me in UBC reading a textbook leisurely just to learn more. You get to learn the protocol stack and how the Internet works! It's really amazing. I really wish there more assignments though. It'll give you experience with socket programming which is definitely an asset you want to have as a developer.

> 100% should take. Networking is an important concept and this course forms the basis of it.

> A fairly interesting course that covers the basics of internet computing. The course goes over each of the five layers of the internet and focuses on a few select protocols from each layer (HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DNS, TCP, IP, DHCP, BGP, VPN, TLS etc.). Jonatan Schroeder (currently at York University) is a great professor who explains the concepts very thoroughly. Beware that there is going to be a lot of technical documentation reading (RFCs) for assignments and the quizzes/exams focus quite heavily on conceptual understanding.
