CS Coffee Chat is a peer mentorship program organized by CSSS and CODE. Every month, students can sign up to be matched with another student, where they'll be introduced via email and encouraged to set up a meeting to get together and chat. The matchings will usually be a senior student matched with a junior student.

Applications are currently open for the October matching, and will close on September 30th. You can find the signup form here. 

For the October matching, participants are invited to attend a kickoff event where they can participate in speed-mentoring. Refreshments will be provided.
