CS Coffee Chat is a peer mentorship program organized by CSSS and CODE. Every month, students can sign up to be matched with another student, where the matched pairs will be introduced via email and encouraged to set up a meeting to get together and chat. The matchings will usually be a senior student with a junior student.

Applications for the October round will open at the start of September and close on September 30th.

For the October round, participants are invited to attend a kickoff event where they can participate in speed-mentoring. Refreshments will be provided. Stay tuned for more updates!
