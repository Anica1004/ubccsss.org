The Cube offers the following services:

## [Food](cube/menu)

We provide a variety of snacks and drinks at affordable prices (many things are less than $1!) to keep you going through those long coding projects in the lab.

## [Career Fair](https://ubctcf.com)

We co-host the annual Tech Career Fair, which gathers technical companies from all over in one place on campus.

## [Tutoring](/services/tutor)

We provide a place for tutors to advertise their availability and for students to find a tutor for Computer Science courses.

## [Exams](/services/exams)

We provide a database of old midterm and final exams for review.

## [Chat Server](https://chat.ubccsss.org)

We run chat/messaging service similar to Slack. Feel free to create new channels and talk to friends. This is designed as a social space for all UBC CS students.

If you would like your own team for a CS associated club please contact the VPC.

## [Social Events](/events)

We run a variety of social events - board game nights, barbecues, and more!

## [Subversion](https://svn.thecube.ca/)

We provide a Subversion server where you can store and version-control source code for your course and personal projects.

## [TRAC](//trac.thecube.ca/)

We provide TRAC environments for bug tracking and project management for course and personal projects (to get a TRAC environment, you must first create a Subversion project; you use the same account in both places).
