<p>Welcome to the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS)! You will be happy to know that if you are a student in the CPSC Department, you are automatically part of the CS Cube!</p>
<p>The CSSS has been busy planning events and doing its best to make a great year for you. Expect biweekly BBQs (weather permitting), IceCubed skating events, Beach Days, the Career Fair, Industry Panels and Info Sessions, volunteer opportunities within the Computer Science Department, Bzzr Gardens, the year-end boat cruise, and much more! Our first event is a T-shirt design contest! More details will be out soon, so be sure to look out for more updates on this site!</p>
<p>As privileged members of the CSSS, please feel free to drop by the Cube lounge, x139, to buy cheap snacks or pop, play with the XBOX 360 or just chillax with your friends and meet other cool Cubers just like you.</p>
