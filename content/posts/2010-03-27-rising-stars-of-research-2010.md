[Rising Stars of Research](http://www.risingstars.ubc.ca/) is an exciting and unique event which brings top undergraduate researchers from across Canada to BC. The centrepiece of RSR is a research poster competition and includes workshops, talks from outstanding faculty researchers, facility tours, and of course, a great time in beautiful British Columbia. New this year is a “Social Sciences” division, in addition to various science and engineering divisions. If you have conducted research, consider presenting it here! Applications are open May 10 to June 14.
