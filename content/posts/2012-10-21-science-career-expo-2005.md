![](/files/escience_logo.gif)Although this event is catered to science students in general, it would be extremely incorrect to say that this isn't relevant to computer science students! Computer science is present in almost all branches of science and so, whatever your reason, this would be a good event to go to.

**Natali Altshuler**, former CS student from Electronic Arts will be there! Don't miss the free advice and food!

CHOOSE FROM A SERIES OF ONE-HOUR PANEL DISCUSSIONS:
