### GIRLsmarts4tech recruiting Technovation mentors

Volunteering as a Technovation mentor is a great way to share your passion for
computer science, and gain leadership and teaching experience. We are looking
for dependable, responsible, enthusiastic people, preferably with a background
in Computer Science, to help mentor teams of 3-5 girls in Grades 8-12 as they
participate in the Technovation Challenge.

The time commitment and schedule will be established by you and your team, but
we encourage you to meet with your team weekly either online or in person. All
undergraduates will be paired with another mentor (either from industry or a
fellow undergraduate) so you can share this responsibility.

Please visit https://technovationchallenge.org/ for more information. To sign
up, please register as a mentor on the Technovation website and fill in this
form. All volunteers are welcome!

We look forward to hearing from you!
