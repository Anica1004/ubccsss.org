We would like to invite students to an information session on Blue Castle Games. Come learn about a local gaming company that has established itself successfully
in the competitive video game industry. Learn about how we developed our technology from scratch, in house, for five different platforms simultaneously. Focus will be on our online development, providing an overview of the design requirements and concerns of bringing a game online, as well as the technical design used to achieve the goal.

When: 

Thursday, October 9, 2008 - 18:30 to 19:30
